![Orion Logo](https://via.placeholder.com/200x80?text=Orion+Logo)

## Introduction

Orion is a next-generation **decentralized simulation platform** powered by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **blockchain technology**. The platform allows users to execute complex Monte Carlo financial simulations, interact with intelligent agents, and verify results on-chain.  

Designed for the **ICP x FET Hackathon**, Orion focuses on **security, transparency, and futuristic user experience** inspired by cyberpunk aesthetics. The platform integrates **Internet Identity login**, **smart agent computation**, and **interactive visualization** of simulation outcomes.

**Key Features:**
- Execute Monte Carlo simulations for financial analysis.
- Store and verify simulation results on the blockchain.
- Secure login with ICP Internet Identity.
- Interactive dashboard with real-time simulation display.
- Cyberpunk-inspired neon theme with smooth animations.
